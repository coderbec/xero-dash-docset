# Contributing
At the moment everything is formatted as Dash Packages or Guides. If you would like to add more selectors, this project uses dashing, so I've included all the html files downloaded from the Xero API documentation in addition to the dashing.json folder you can edit to add more selectors and then rebuild as per the dashing documentation.
