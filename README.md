# xero-dash-docset
[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) compatible docset for [Xero API](https://developer.xero.com/).

# Instructions
Double click on xeroapi.docset to open it in Dash.

# Contributing
At the moment everything is formatted as [Dash Packages or Guides](https://kapeli.com/docsets#supportedentrytypes). If you would like to add more selectors, this project uses [dashing](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing), so I've included all the html files downloaded from the Xero API documentation in addition to the dashing.json folder you can edit to add more selectors and then rebuild as per the dashing documentation.

# ToDo
Currently working out how to get even more Dash object types out of the CSS from the Xero docs. As this is based on our HTML docs, we're limited in what we've got available in the respective CSS classes, but we'll see what we can find. Enjoy!
